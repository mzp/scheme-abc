# Mention a few of the other standard variables here.

# \begin{doc}
# \section{The OMakeroot file}
# \index{OMakeroot}
#
# The standard \File{OMakeroot} file defines the functions are rules
# for building standard projects.
#
# \subsection{Variables}
# \var{ROOT} The root directory of the current project.
# \var{CWD} The current working directory (the directory is set for each \File{OMakefile} in the project).
# \var{EMPTY} The empty string.
# \var{STDROOT} The name of the standard installed \File{OMakeroot} file.
# \end{doc}

#
# A default sort rule

.ORDER: .BUILDORDER

#
# \begin{doc}
# \varlabel{ABORT_ON_COMMAND_ERROR}{ABORT\_ON\_COMMAND\_ERROR} If set to true, the construction of a target should
#   be aborted whenever one of the commands to build it fail.  This defaults to true,
#   and should normally be left that way.
#
# \varlabel{SCANNER_MODE}{SCANNER\_MODE} This variable should be defined as one of four values
#    (defaults to \verb+enabled+).
# \begin{description}
# \item[enabled] Allow the use of default \verb+.SCANNER+ rules.  Whenever a rule does
#    not specify a \verb+:scanner:+ dependency explicitly, try to find a
#    \verb+.SCANNER+ with the same target name.
# \item[disabled] Never use default \verb+.SCANNER+ rules.
# \item[warning] Allow the use of default \verb+.SCANNER+ rules, but print a warning
#    whenever one is selected.
# \item[error] Do not allow the use of default \verb+.SCANNER+ rules.  If a rule
#    does not specify a \verb+:scanner:+ dependency, and there is a default
#    \verb+.SCANNER+ rule, the build will terminate abnormally.
# \end{description}

# SCANNER_MODE = enabled

# Generic Unix section
#

#
# \begin{doc}
# \subsection{System variables}
#
# \var{INSTALL} The command to install a program (\verb+install+ on \verb+Unix+, \verb+cp+ on \verb+Win32+).
# \var{PATHSEP} The normal path separator (\verb+:+ on \verb+Unix+, \verb+;+ on \verb+Win32+).
# \var{DIRSEP} The normal directory separator (\verb+/+ on \verb+Unix+, \verb+\+ on \verb+Win32+).
# \varlabel{EXT_OBJ}{EXT\_OBJ} File suffix for an object file (default is \verb+.o+ on \verb+Unix+, and \verb+.obj+ on \verb+Win32+).
# \varlabel{EXT_LIB}{EXT\_LIB} File suffix for a static library (default is \verb+.a+ on \verb+Unix+, and \verb+.lib+ on \verb+Win32+).
# \varlabel{EXT_DLL}{EXT\_DLL} File suffix for a shared library (default is \verb+.so+ on \verb+Unix+, and \verb+.dll+ on \verb+Win32+).
# \varlabel{EXT_ASM}{EXT\_ASM} File suffix for an assembly file (default is \verb+.s+ on \verb+Unix+, and \verb+.asm+ on \verb+Win32+).
# \var{EXE} File suffix for executables (default is empty for \verb+Unix+, and \verb+.exe+ on \verb+Win32+ and \verb+Cygwin+).
